This archive contains the example source code for
"JDBC Recipes", first edition, by Mahmoud Parsian.

1. I believe in "free" software and I do support 
   The Free Software Foundation's principle: 
   Free software is a matter of liberty not price. 
   You should think of "free" as in "free speech"

2. All of the code in this package/zip has been
   written by Mahmoud Parsian; each chapter has 
   source code for that chapter. Please feel free
   to cut-and-paste my code in your JDBC applications.

3. The packages directory contains packages used by 
   the author for creating client programs; to compile 
   these, go to specific directories and use "javac" 
   (Java compiler). You may use JDK 1.4.2 or JDK 1.5 
   for compiling provided programs. 
   
4. I have included some extra programs in the "jcb" 
   package, which are not included in the "JDBC Recipes" 
   book. For compiling these extra programs, you need the 
   .jar file for JDOM (www.jdom.org).
   
5. Make sure to use proper/valid database user/password 
   for provided programs.
   
6. Make sure to include MySQL's/Oracle's driver package 
   (JDBC Driver .jar files) in your CLASSPATH (environment 
   variable).
   

7. NOTE: do not install these examples in a folder whose 
   path name contains spaces.

8. If you use my code for production systems, please make 
   sure that you replace getConnection() method with a 
   "production quality" pool management system such as
   Apache's Excalibur (http://excalibur.apache.org/).

9. If you encounter any problems in compiling/running 
   programs, please let me know by sending email to:
